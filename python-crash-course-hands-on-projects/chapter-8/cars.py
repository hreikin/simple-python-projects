# Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary. The 
# function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then 
# accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. 
# 
# Call the function with the required information and two other name-value 
# pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a 
# call like this one:
# 
# car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True) 
# 
# Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was 
# stored correctly.
