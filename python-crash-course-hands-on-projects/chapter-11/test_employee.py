# Write a class called Employee. The __init__() method should take in a first 
# name, a last name, and an annual salary, and store each of these as 
# attributes. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the annual 
# salary by default but also accepts a different raise amount. Write a test case 
# for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_default_raise() and 
# test_give_custom_raise(). Use the setUp() method so you donâ€™t have to create a 
# new employee instance in each test method. Run your test case, and make sure 
# both tests pass.
