# Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning 
# and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and 
# "\n" , at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name 
# is displayed. Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, 
# lstrip() , rstrip() , and strip() .
