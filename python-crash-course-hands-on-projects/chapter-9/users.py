# Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name and last_name 
# and then create several other attributes that are typically stored in a user 
# profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary of the 
# userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints a 
# personalized greeting to the user. Create several instances representing 
# different users, and call both methods for each user.
