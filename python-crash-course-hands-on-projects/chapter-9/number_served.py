# Start with your program from "restaurant.py". Add an attribute called 
# number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance called restaurant 
# from this class. Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and 
# then change this value and print it again. 
# 
# Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of 
# customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number and print 
# the value again.
#
# Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the 
# number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. Call this method with any number you 
# like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of 
# business.
