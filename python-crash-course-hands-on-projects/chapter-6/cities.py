# Make a dictionary called cities. Use the names of three cities as keys in 
# your dictionary. Create a dictionary of information about each city and 
# include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one 
# fact about that city. The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something 
# like country , population , and fact . Print the name of each city and all of 
# the information you have stored about it.
