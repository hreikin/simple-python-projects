# Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys 
# in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To 
# make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of 
# their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s 
# name and their favorite places.
