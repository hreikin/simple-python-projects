# # You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a 
# different word. Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' 
# in a sentence:
#
# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'
#
# Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and 
# replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print 
# each modified line to the screen.
