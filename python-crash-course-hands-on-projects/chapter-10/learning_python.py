# Open a blank file in your text editor and write a few lines summarizing what 
# youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line with the phrase In Python 
# you can.... Save the file as learning_python.txt in the same directory as your 
# exercises from this chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints 
# what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire 
# file, once by looping over the file object, and once by storing the lines in a 
# list and then working with them outside the with block.
